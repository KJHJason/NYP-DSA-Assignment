    To heapify subtree rooted at index idx. 
    
    Binary heap is a complete binary tree 
    (all levels are completely filled, except possibly the last level 
    and the last level has nodes that are filled from left to right)
    
    Binary heap properties:
    - in ascending order (max-heap): 
        - at any node, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the values of its children
        - the value of the root node is the largest value in the subtree
    - in descending order (min-heap): 
        - at any node, the value of the node is less than or equal to the values of its children
        - the value of the root node is the smallest value in the subtree
    
    Requires 4 arguments:
    - arr (list): The array of elements to heapify
    - heapSize (int): the size of the array/heap
    - idx (int): the index of the root of the subtree
    - reverse (bool): whether to make it a max-heap or a min-heap (Default: False)

    Worst time complexity: O(log n)
    Average time complexity: O(log n)
